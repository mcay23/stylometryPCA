really grateful to you senator and sentomcotton marcorubio for introducing legislation to stop silicon valley censorship the fact google thinks they can deplatform publications because they agree with their politics is petrifying  dangerous to all

at a time when conservatives and democrats are scheming to take away big techs liability protection it does not strike me as tactically sound for google to argue that the federalist should be held responsible for its comments section
why are only conservative sites threatened with bans over their comments
nbc ran a story with this quote from a google spokesperson a page or site violates our policies we take action in this case removed both ability to monetize with google saying they never said
google is now trafficking in digital fascism how soon until all conservative speech and publications are completely
the federalist is a half reporting half commentary website you dont have to agree with the commentary the fact google and nbc news are now defunding websites over commentary is going to have disastrous side effects and backlash hope they are ready for it
