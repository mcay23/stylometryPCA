earlier this month theviews meghanmccain interviewed our interim ceo james winans to discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on people experiencing homelessness and how anyone can help even from home
we already know that the consequences of giving antisemites a pass can lead to horror apparently those who pose as the supposedly enlightened guardians of our culture have either forgotten that or no longer care about
we will not be silenced by nbcnews or google they tried they will try again and they will
ben domenech bdomenech and i have an oped in the wall street journal today detailing the campaign by nbc news and google to deplatform not just coming for us theyre coming for all of
watch krystalball and esaagar on big tech google and nbc
really grateful to you senator and sentomcotton marcorubio for introducing legislation to stop silicon valley censorship the fact google thinks they can deplatform publications because they agree with their politics is petrifying  dangerous to all
today introducing new legislation to combat bigtech censorship it gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally proud to be joined by
if google  youtube cared about comments on their own sites as much they do on others the parkland killer would have been reported to law enforcement and my daughter alaina and 16 others would be
lmao they tried fucking with the federalist now the libs are throwing each other under the bus trying to escape before hawley drags them in front of congress
the comments section was uniquely pernicious in exactly the same way as tom oped was uniquely in violation of the rigorous standards how unfortunate we have been to discover two such outliers in a single month the odds were astronomical
im glad that nbc news decided to try to demonetize the federalist it just demonstrates once again that socalled journalists are often mere activists in disguise
a fresh sign of googles editorial via nypost
ill be on tucker carlsons show on fox news tonight to talk about nbc newss attempted assassination of fdrlst and googles threats to demonetize and deplatform our news organization
wait wait  you want to treat the fdrlst comment section which they curate as their speech but simultaneously say the content you directly host and modify is not your speech under section 230 wow this is getting really
at a time when conservatives and democrats are scheming to take away big techs liability protection it does not strike me as tactically sound for google to argue that the federalist should be held responsible for its comments section
why are only conservative sites threatened with bans over their comments
nbc ran a story with this quote from a google spokesperson a page or site violates our policies we take action in this case removed both ability to monetize with google saying they never said
google is now trafficking in digital fascism how soon until all conservative speech and publications are completely
the federalist is a half reporting half commentary website you dont have to agree with the commentary the fact google and nbc news are now defunding websites over commentary is going to have disastrous side effects and backlash hope they are ready for it
love you bdomenech  i am insanely proud of what you have built from the ground up your incredible fearless rabble rousing staff and writers  and how much all of you threaten all the right elites and people in power conservatives in america will never be censored or silencedpictwittercomabjemdmxsi

you have to be a conservative or like trump to know that meghanmccain is absolutely right here

the analysis of the commentary podcast has been carrying me through the last 4 months of the pandemic and beyond so grateful for the work you all do at the magazine and podcast

thank you sir may i have another is what he should have said unless
yes its rooted in kneeling to god in prayer show me reverend mlk kneeling to any man in subservience ever specifically because of their race ill
an equal and opposite reaction cannot be extremism what is an equal and opposite reaction to 25deaths 400 officers seriously injured billions in property damage and city blocks taken over with guns
cell phone video coming in a few had to get a lot off of my chest dont care the result
officers are 185 times more likely to be shot by a black criminal than they are to shoot an unarmed black man truth matterspictwittercomm2qffnf89n
you either believe that officer garrett rolfe deserves to die the penalty for that this is impermissible or you are a coward
all i can say is that with the shortage thank you sigsauerinc for sending the ammo it is appreciated and sorely needed thank you
to all the good officers thank you for your service but none of us would blame you if you walked we understand
elony murder charge from da sends a clear message to all atlanta pd allow a man to assault you and your partner allow him to steal your taser and allow him to shoot you or face death row
i wouldnt be surprised if every single atlanta police officer both black and white walk off the force tomorrow felony murder ridiculous
expect the charge of felony murder to not stick due to decades of precedent and then even more insane riots chanting no justice no peace this is going to get worse
felony murder is reserved for people who were already committing a felony prior to the murder like a bank robbery gone wrong what was the felony before the shooting attempting to handcuff a serial felon who failed a sobriety test
this is not a fake tweet from the
pretty broad brush you used

you dont get that simply showing appreciation for officers doesnt take away from denouncing the bad
thank you officers
good news aunt jemima has been canceled and racism is solved
when you defund the police expect a state of lawless vigilantism in that state expect the side thats been fighting for gun rights and accruing them for decades to win
the left has forced all conservatives and trump supporters underground no flags hats or bumper stickers we dont answer polls you cant know what awaits you in november you just cant
keep in mind the pressure for this corporate censorship comes from nbcuniversalvox the same people responsible for voxadpocalypse this is a 2nd coming and google is bending

y lifetime never feared witnessing an actual civil war but when an american city is taken over by lawless criminals with guns can anyone be surprised when citizens try to take it back also with guns turn back now please chaz chop
so chaz now has without elections laws without votes enforcement without accountability and zero protections for journalists or free speech this is the progressive of do i have that right

my wife just took her first couple steps without her walker i played this for and she cried  i know if that makes me a terrible husband or the best husband
if a is not a deadly why advocate it to women for rapedefense in place of a
ust a basic white guy i know and even i imagine a world in which i attack two cops punch them in the face steal their weapon and not get shot atlantashooting rayshardbrooks
i thought george zimmerman a douche mind you was supposed to call the police
what if woke up a seriously intoxicated rayshardbrooks and he violently assaulted them resulting in death happens every day and why we have what are called
also how much do you want to bet the the violent assault on officers over a simple dui has to do with past charges how about my entire media platform against your potential vp candidacy
wow a potential vp and you show the whole violent repeated assault on the officers along with stealing their weapon and aiming it at them
did you just imply that when interacting with black men that cops should act more like
incorrect he was unarmed until he assaulted the officers and stole their taser
the atlantashooting hashtag is showing you only the short portion where the man was shot not this portion where the main wrestled officers punched them in the face stole taser and attempted to use it on them
genuinely how do we want officers to subdue violent criminals strikes guns tasers tranquilizers jointlocks all include serious risks and caveats what do we think is the best solution
one of these is a literal chokehold while the other is an entirely legal wrestling headlock can you tell the difference can all of our officers should either be allowed to control a perppictwittercom61ntdflbda
i am all for banning chokeholds if provided with a safer more easily executed alternative which results in both less damage to the perp and increased safety to the officer would genuinely love to hear solutions
any examples kneeling on the back of a neck is not and cannot be applied as a chokehold all for banning kneesonnecks that is not a
ll for better training for all law enforcement but anyone who competes in or watches mma knows for a fact that many many careers have been ended from strikes and jointlocks gone wrong none from chokeholds
how would you have an officer subdue a violent criminal on a drug like say pcp making him nearly impervious to pain a properly applied chokehold results in no pain or long term damage compared to jointlocks or tasers which often can greatly

nothing drives a leftist nuts more than a factual
charge or block a vehicle and break the windshield with the driver still in it congratulations you are now a speed bump
do they think
a president who invokes the insurrection act while also ensuring the preservation of the 2nd amendment is not a man using it against his citizens using it to help protect citizens
it has everything to do with what talking about and every gun owner knows
justiceforjamesscurlock is yet another hoax in which a man defended himself while being gangbeaten mercilessly and repeatedly charges rightfully dropped a timeline with all relevant footage can be found
you have the right to protest you do not have the right to damage property or people you have the right to speak out you do not have the right to dangerously block traffic any questions
ive seen that and think its a wonderful start why arent we seeing that from blacklivesmatter
have any blacklivesmatter leaders condemned the riots and helped the folks who are out there protecting black businesses any of them helping bring this to an end one hello
hey twitter and jack how about a factcheck you can disagree with infowars many do but the fire was verifiably set by blacklivesmatter and antifa rioters all on film
democrats continue to unilaterally support these rioters across their cities okay democrats you now own it
breaking epidemiologists find promise in new covid19 cure violent riots
no rule of law no peace noruleoflawnopeace
what if its to push through a mass of violent rioters actively blocking the fire department from saving an innocent child trapped in the building they bombed
can we praise the firefighters and first responders whove been blocked and violently attacked as the true heroes  or is that title just reserved for furloughed nurses on tiktok
these men beat a mans wife and held him at bay with weapons so that he would have to watch they these men specifically forfeit their right to live
homes have been set ablaze and subsequent firefighters blocked from providing aid yes in that instance protect your children with your semi
if you violently attack a nonviolent civilian you forfeit your right to live period
the violent felons in this video forfeit their right to live
remember this week the next time liberals tell you that you need semiautomatic weapons because you should just call the cops
i personally own a preremington marlin and very much prefer it but they are very hard to come by lets not get nerdy here but help those who arent hobbyists
no that would be the rioters i am unapologetically saying that lawabiding citizens should defend their family and their property by any means necessary without exception
for new firearm owners its hard to beat a handguncarbine combo same ammo and little recoil with large capacity two examples a 9mm walther ppq  sig mpx or a 357 revolver and rossi lever action
im sponsored by waltherfirearms and highly recommend the ppq for personal defense but many gun stores are sold out so buy from any reliable brands like hecklerandkoch colt glockinc fnamerica and particularly sigsauerinc also their ammo
remember when rioters block police cars they are also blocking the fire department from putting out fires to save lives unless police push through innocent people will die this has to stop
you encouraged and supported this your photo opp narrative does not wash the blood from your
do not allow history to be rewritten our grandchildren can never be taught that these were with some exceptions these protests were violent criminal thuggery from the start designed to intimidate americans into silence
protect your family defend your property stay safe
last night rioters set fire to a house with a child inside then blocked the fire
dont forget we infiltrated and caught live footage of antifa plotting violent crimes footage which led to arrests and the media ignored this is not new video
bad police officers need to be held accountable rioting thugs and antifa need to be held accountable for the same reasons any questions
oops producer handled my twitter for tonight while livestreaming didnt realize i doubleposted my final goodnight and now three times okay bye now  now
wrapping up with final thoughts on the
we just went live with elijahschaffer to hear the story of the man almost beaten to death by rioters at the dallasprotests seems the victim is now stable according to reports
just let him die  protesters at the now with elijahschaffer telling us the story of this man who tried to defend himself against the mob and was stoned on the street
going live to hear full story on man who was beaten within an inch of his life from elijahschaffer who took the video at the

bill de blasio is a disgrace crowderriotstream
this seems
violent rioters now trying to breach the white

when antilockdown business owners protested opencarrying their rifles not a single crime was committed in every single city where protests erupted last night violent felonies were committed every single one
this is a historic moment and none of the networks are calling true balls and strikes im going to do a cnnfactchecklivestream marathon tonight stay tuned for details
met a black couple stocking up on ammo at academy found common ground we talked for 30 mins about georgefloyd tragedy the awful riots tearing the country apart and then frazierali trilogy we are not beyond hope
violence is not speech
the government does not have the authority to shut down a private business indefinitely it does have the authority to subdue and arrest citizens who are violently infringing on the rights of others any questions
orry these rioters will not be held accountable california is too busy preparing to arrest churchgoers
be sure to remember covid19 was on the downtrend until violent rioters gathered by the thousands flagrantly disregarding federal social distancing guidelines
i am vehemently against nearly everything that cnn stands for and i think theyve done harm to the country i also support their right to defend their people and property by any means necessary stay safe guys
ot some you can borrow stop looting you lowlife thugs for
silver lining tonight theres a reason to actually stay home though with a loaded gun on your nightstand stay safe
i want justiceforgeorgefloyd and think the officer was wrong i also support serious intervention in these violent riots right now this cant go on
interesting id argue buttersoft bitches who encourage violence on twitter and pretend to be tough
when there is a disagreement between a violent looter and a nonviolent looter the nonviolent looter automatically does enjoy moral superiority you
how about discouraging violent thuggery altogether

please take a second and stop i want to see fewer dead americans black or white these riots will lead to more please stop blacklivesmatter alllivesmatter
question the president has already expressed disgust and called for justice for george floyd so how will violent looting make you any more heard
anyone who insinuates that you or realdonaldtrump have ever expressed otherwise is a liar
if you use the word thugs to refer to people intimidating assaulting and burning down property of innocent bystanders you use the word thugs
justice is holding police officers accountable justice is demanding better training and criteria for officers justice is protesting and being heard justice is not destroying property and assaulting fellow americans
my concern as a business owner i know i would absolutely exercise constitutionally protected measures to defend my business should looters violently attack it this will not end well please stop this before its too late
my heart breaks for family it also breaks for the business owners who were shut down by the govt for months only to slowly reopen and watch their livelihoods burn to the ground thank god they responded in kind
